## What is Velto good for?

Velto, with its RVC (Route - View - Controller) architecture, is great for lightweight, fast-to-build projects that don’t need the complexity of full-stack frameworks.

### Perfect for:
1. **Landing Pages**  
   - Fast setup, focused on views.  
   - Great for product, app, or portfolio pages.  
   - _Examples: SaaS landing, personal portfolio, event promo page._

2. **Microsites / Mini Sites**  
   - One or a few simple pages with controller logic.  
   - _Examples: Seminar registration, basic survey site, company profile._

3. **Static Content Generator (without DB)**  
   - Store content in arrays or files.  
   - _Examples: File-based blog, documentation site, learning material site._

4. **Prototypes / MVPs**  
   - Rapid idea validation.  
   - _Examples: Simple order forms, basic reporting tools, form-based apps._

5. **Web Tools / Online Utilities**  
   - Calculators, generators, converters, etc.  
   - _Examples: QR code generator, markdown to HTML converter, developer tools._

6. **Frontend for External APIs**  
   - Use Velto as a frontend layer for API consumption.  
   - _Examples: API dashboards, weather apps, shipment tracking._
